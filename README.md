# Concurrent-Completion-and-Part-Segmentation-for-3D-Missing-Point-Clouds-viaSynergistic-Feature-Mappig

We are GroupPointCloud from CS484-555 (Bilkent University - Fall 2020). Here is a brief description of our project:

Scene understanding in 3D point clouds commonly requires part segmentation of the objects that aims to semantically cluster each point into multiple distinct regions manifesting the same characteristics. In this project, we proposed a novel architecture with joint use of 3D convolutional layers, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and differentiable gridding layers for concurrent completion and part segmentation of partial 3D point cloud objects via synergistic feature aggregation from completion and segmentation branches. Comprehensive experiments performed on the ShapeNet-Part dataset clearly demonstrate that the proposed method effectively recovers complete point cloud objects and semantically segments their parts while maintaining equivalent performance to the gold-standard method directly performing completion from missing acquisitions. This study therefore holds a great promise to enhance practicality and utility of point clouds for 3D vision.
